# Logic Gates

A logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
But, here this repository in not meant to tell you about logic gates but to tell you about Neural Networks by implementing logic gates using it.

This will not tell about working of different types of Neural networks but you will definitely become familier with the TFlearn and Keral. TFlearn and Keras are both widely popular higher level API built on the top of the Tensorflow. They are designed to reduce the complexity of the Tensorflow workflow while working with Machine Learning models.

If you are not familier with the Tensorflow then visit my repository: [ML](https://github.com/prashplus/ML).

Setup the prerequisites and start following the below steps.
