# Loss Functions

This MD context will explain you Loss functions with minimal efforts.

## What’s A Loss Function?

At its core, a loss function is incredibly simple: it’s a method of evaluating how well your algorithm models your dataset. If your predictions are totally off, your loss function will output a higher number. If they’re pretty good, it’ll output a lower one. As you change pieces of your algorithm to try and improve your model, your loss function will tell you if you’re getting anywhere.

We can design our own basic loss function to further explain how it works. For each prediction that we make, our loss function will simply measure the absolute difference between our prediction and the actual value. In mathematical notation, it might look something **abs(y_predicted - y)**.
